# 🗣️ Voice-Activated Personal Assistant
**Your Intelligent, Voice-Powered Helper**

This project was created as part of the CODEXINTERN Python Development Internship (December 2024). It showcases skills in Python programming, API integration, and building voice-enabled applications. From setting reminders to fetching real-time weather updates, this assistant is your productivity companion.

## 🌟 Key Features
- 🎙️ **Voice Recognition**: Understands and processes user commands through speech recognition.
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Responses**: Delivers clear, human-like responses using the pyttsx3 library.
- 📰 **Smart Task Execution**: Perform tasks like setting reminders 📅, checking the weather 🌤️, and reading the latest news 📰.
- 🌐 **Real-Time Data Integration**: Fetch real-time updates (e.g., weather and news) via APIs.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Framework**: Easily extend functionality to suit specific needs.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the assistant:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
  To install the required libraries for this project, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   pip install speechrecognition
   pip install pyttsx3
   pip install requests
   pip install pytz
  
2. **Configure APIs**
  - Obtain an API key for OpenWeatherMap for weather updates.
  - (Optional) Set up NewsAPI for accessing the latest news.
  - Store the API keys securely in the script or a .env file.
  - Refer to the .env.example file for configuration.
3. **Run the Assistant**
    Start the assistant using the following command:
    ```bash
    python assistant.py
4. **Interact with Assistant**
   Speak into your microphone to issue commands like:

  - “What’s the weather in [City]?” 🌤️
  - “Tell me the latest news.” 📰
  - “Set a reminder to [Task] at [Time].” ⏰
